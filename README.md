# üì∞ Fake News Detection using Traditional ML and BERT
This project detects fake news articles using two approaches:
- ‚úÖ Classical machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- ü§ñ Transformer-based deep learning with BERT

The goal is to compare the performance of these methods and build a robust fake news classification system using real-world data.

## üìÅ Dataset

The full dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).

We use a labeled public dataset containing **real** and **fake** news articles. The dataset has two separate CSV files:
- `Fake.csv`: Fake news articles with columns like `title` and `text`
- `True.csv`: Real news articles


Each file is preprocessed and labeled:
- `0`: Fake news
- `1`: Real news
## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
   - Combine title and text fields into a single content column
   - Clean text using: Lowercasing, Removing punctuation/numbers, Removing stopwords and Stemming
2. **Classical ML Pipeline**
    - Split data into training and test sets
    - Vectorize text using TF-IDF
    - Train models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes
    - Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

3. **BERT Pipeline**:
    - Used bert-base-uncased
    - Tokenized text with truncation and padding
    - Fine-tuned BERT model on the dataset using `TFBertForSequenceClassification` with:
        - Batch size of 16
        - Learning rate of 2e-5
        - Epochs: 3
    - Model trained using `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy`

## üöÄ Web App (Streamlit)
A minimal Streamlit interface (app.py) lets users interactively test news headlines or articles.

How it works:
- User inputs a news article
- Model predicts whether the news is real or fake
- Shows confidence score and class probabilities
